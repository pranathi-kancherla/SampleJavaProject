# Rate Limiting
### Why Rate Limiting came into picture?
Users could use up resources in a way that affects others, whether accidentally or on purpose. The server may run out of resources if numerous requests are made for those resources over an extended period of time. Memory, threads, connections, and other finite resources are examples of these resources.To avoid this issue, rate limiter came into picture.
### What is Rate Limiting?
Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate at which a client can send requests to a server. It is often used to prevent abuse, such as a denial-of-service attack or brute-force attack, and to ensure fair usage of a shared resource.
### Need of Rate Limiting
* Rate-limiting is used to limit network traffic.
* Rate limiting protects our application from denial-of-service attacks (DoS).
* It helps us manage server resources efficiently when a high volume of requests is received.
* Rate limiting helps to improve the performance of our application by reducing unnecessary delays in sending back responses.
* Rate-limiting reduces costs.
